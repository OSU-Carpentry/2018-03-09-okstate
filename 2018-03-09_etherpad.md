#**Day 1 (2018-03-02)**

Create a new project: 

   * File menu --> New Project
   * Choose New Directory
   * Choose New Project
   * Directory name: r\_project
   * Create as subdirectory of: ~/Desktop
   * Click "Create Project"

Note the prompt in the console. Normally the prompt appears as the greater than symbol ">" but sometimes appears as a plus "+" when your current command is waiting for more input.

Assignment operator is "<-" instead of "=".

   * Rather than typing "<" and "-", you can also click "Alt"+"-". 
   *  "Option"+"-" for mac usersAssign the value 55 to the variable weight\_kg:

   * weight\_kg <- 55Surround the command with parentheses to get "verbose" output:

   * (weight\_kg <- 55)Multiply by 2.2 (but don't save into a variable):

   * 2.2 * weight\_kgMultiply by 2.2 and save into the variable weight\_lb:

   * weight\_lb <- 2.2 * weight\_lb
Note that the values assigned to the variables weight\_kg and weight\_lb are independent. If we change weight\_kg, weight\_lb will **not **change automatically.

Lines beginning with the "#" character are **comments** and R will not try to interpret them as commands. You can use comments for notes to document your code OR to remove a section of code without deleting it.
To comment out a section of the script, highlight the lines to be commented and click "Ctrl"+"Shift"+"C" ("Cmd"+"Shift"+"C" for Mac users). You can use the same command to *un*-comment out a section and deleted the "#" script.

##Functions

Functions are sets of one or more commands packaged together under a function name. You can call the function name to run the function. There are many functions built into the R language and you can write your own functions too.

Call the built in square root function to find the square root of 2:

   * sqrt(2)In this example, 2 is an **argument **or **parameter **that we pass to the sqrt() function.

Multiple arguments to a function are separated by commas. Arguments can be positional or named.

The built-in round() function takes two arguments: "x", the number to be rounded, and "digits", the number of digits past the decimal point.
Positional argument exmple:

   * round(3.14159, 2)Named argument example:

   * round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)

Use "Ctrl"+"L" to clear the console.

   * Here is a good list of most keyboard shortcuts in RStudio: \url{https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts}
   * 

##Vectors

"To the vector go the spoils." -- from *The Dot and the Line*

Vectors contain multiple values (similar to arrays in other programming languages). All values in a vector must be the same data type (e.g. all strings, all numbers, etc).

Use the c() function to **combine** multiple values into a vector.

Create a vector called weight\_g with three values:

   * weight\_g <- c(50, 60, 82)
"> ?c" indicates the 'c' stands for **underlinecunderline**ombine values into a vector or list. 

Add a fourth value to the end of the weight\_g vector:

   * weight\_g <- c(weight\_g, 90)
Add another value to the beginning of the weight\_g vector:

   * weight\_g <- c(30, weight\_g)
You can refer to elements inside vectors using numeric indexes. R uses one-based indexes (the first element is 1); many other programming languages use zero-based indexing where the first element is 0.

   * animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")To get the value "rat", use the expression:

   * animals[2]To get the values "rat" and "dog", use the expression:

   * animals[c(2,3)]
You can also create new vectors by using logical conditions.

   * weight\_g <-  c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)This expression will return a new vector containing only 21 and 55:

   * weight\_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]This expression will return a vector of TRUE and FALSE values like in the line above:

   * weight\_g > 50We can also use expressions like this inside brackets:

   * weight\_g[weight\_g > 50]And we can combine conditions by using logical operators for AND ("\&") and for OR ("|"):

   * weight\_g[weight\_g < 30 | weight\_g > 50]

Here are some of the common operators: \url{https://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html}


##Downloading and Importing Data

Make a new folder called "data" in your r\_project directory, then run this line to download a CSV file of data:

   * download.file("\url{https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169}", "data/portal\_data\_joined.csv")
Read the CSV file into a dataframe:

   * surveys <- read.csv("data/portal\_data\_joined.csv")
Look at the first few rows of data:

   * head(surveys)
Inspect the structure of the dataframe:

   * str(surveys)
Get the dimensions (number of rows, number of columns) of the dataframe:

   * dim(surveys)
You can access individual elements using numeric indexes in [row, column] form.
Get the value in the 6th column on the first row:

   * surveys[1, 6]
Factors -- the dataframe imported earlier will have its character/string values converted to a numeric code. To prevent this, you can set the "stringsAsFactors" argument to FALSE in the read.csv() function.

   * surveys <- read.csv("data/portal\_data\_joined.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
   * 

   * 





#**Day 2 (2018-03-09)**


Create a new project: 

   * File menu --> New Project
   * Choose New Directory
   * Choose New Project
   * Directory name: r\_workshop\_part\_2
   * Create as subdirectory of: ~/Desktop
   * Click "Create Project"
   * 

Creating Variables:

   * weight\_kg <- 55
   * weight\_lb <- 2.2 * weight\_kg
   * 
Vectors -- combining multiple values into a single variable:

   * weight\_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
   * animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
Adding values to a vector:

   * animals <- c(animals, "cat")
Retrieving a single value from a vector:

   * animals[3]      # This should show "dog"

Download the dataset we'll be working with today:

   * Create a new folder called "data" in the files tab.
   * download.file("\url{https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169}", "data/portal\_data\_joined.csv")
Install the "tidyverse" package:    # you'll only need to do this once

   * install.packages("tidyverse")
Load the tidyverse package:   # you'll need to do this whenever you want to use tidyverse

   * library("tidyverse")
Load the data into your workspace:

   * surveys <- read\_csv("data/portal\_data\_joined.csv")
Look at the structure of the data:

   * str(surveys)
Select specific columns of the dataset:

   * select(surveys, plot\_id, species\_id, weight)
Select specific rows of the dataset:

   * filter(surveys, year == 1995)     # remember that the double equals sign *tests* for equality; a single equals sign *assigns* a value
Use a "pipe" to select data using both column and row criteria:

   * surveys %>% filter(weight < 5) %>% select(species\_id, sex, weight)
You can use the keyboard shortcut [Ctrl]-[Shift]-m to produce the pipe operator (%>%).

surveys\_sml <- surveys %>% filter(weight < 5) %>% select(species\_id, sex, weight)

Create a new column, weight\_kg:

   * surveys %>% mutate(weight\_kg = weight / 1000)
Create two new columns:

   * surveys %>% mutate(weight\_kg = weight / 1000, weight\_kg2 = weight\_kg * 2)
Get rid of NA values:

   * surveys %> filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% mutate(weight\_kg = weight / 1000) %>% select(species\_id, weight, weight\_kg) %>% head()
surveys %>% group\_by(sex) %>% summarize(mean\_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))

surveys %>% filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% group\_by(sex, species\_id) %>% summarize(mean\_weight = mean(weight), min\_weight = min(weight))

surveys %>% filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% group\_by(sex, species\_id) %>% summarize(mean\_weight = mean(weight), min\_weight = min(weight)) %>% print(n = 64)

Create a new tibble, surveys\_complete, by filtering out the records from surveys with missing data:

   * surveys\_complete <- surveys %>% filter(species\_id != "", !is.na(weight), !is.na(hindfoot\_length), sex != "")Make a tibble of the species IDs and number of records containing only species IDs that have at least 50 records:

   * species\_counts <- surveys\_complete %>% group\_by(species\_id) %>% tally() %>% filter(n >= 50)
Filter down surveys\_complete to only include the species IDs listed in species\_counts.

   * surveys\_complete <- surveys\_complete %>% filter(species\_id %in% species\_counts$species\_id)

##Plotting with ggplot

# this just gives you a blank plot
ggplot(data = surveys\_complete)   

# this does the same thing with the addition of an x-y grid and axis labels
ggplot(data = surveys\_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot\_length)) 

# This does the same but now adds the points
ggplot(data = surveys\_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot\_length)) + geom\_point()

# Save the plot as a variable
surveys\_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys\_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot\_length)) 

# Display the plot
surveys\_plot + geom\_point()

# Display the plot with a transparency value (alpha), and a custom color:
surveys\_plot + geom\_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "blue")

# Add an aesthetic to plot each species ID with a different color (the colors are chosen automatically)
surveys\_plot + geom\_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = species\_id))


surveys\_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys\_complete, aes(x = species\_id, y = weight))
surveys\_plot + geom\_boxplot()
surveys\_plot + geom\_boxplot(alpha = 0) + geom\_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato")
# Flip the order of the layers
surveys\_plot + geom\_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato") + geom\_boxplot(alpha = 0)
